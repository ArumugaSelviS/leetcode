Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.



class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int sum=0,n=nums.length;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            sum+=nums[i];
        }
        int num=(n*(n+1)/2)-sum;
        return num;
    }
}
